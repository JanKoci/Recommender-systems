One of the tenants of microservices, and a way to minimize dependencies, is that \u201ca service should own its own database.\u201d This is easier said than done. Why? Because: your data. In working with data in information systems for 5 decades, application developers have accepted the practice of using relational databases and relying on all of their safety guarantees. But, as we build services architectures that span more than one database by design (as with microservices), things get harder. How do we synchronize data across databases, especially heterogeneous data? Developing for the traditional enterprise, we have to build fast-changing systems that are surrounded by legacy systems with complicated domains like finance, insurance, and retail. So, how do we develop and reason about the boundaries in our system to reduce complexity in the domain? In this session, we\u2019ll explore these problems and see how domain driven design (DDD) helps grapple with the domain complexity. We\u2019ll see how DDD concepts like entities and aggregates help us understand boundaries\u2014based on use cases and how transactions are affected. With transactional boundaries, we can more carefully adjust our needs from the CAP theorem to scale out and achieve autonomous systems with eventual strictly ordered consistency. We\u2019ll see how technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Camel, and Debezium.io can help build the backbone for these types of systems.

In this session, we will show you how JBoss AS7 with its new architecture and a new set of features provides an ideal environment for developing and deploying Spring applications. There are multiple ways in which a Spring developer can benefit from the overall goodness that is JBoss AS7. On one hand, you can use it as a generic Java EE 6 application server and stay up-to-date with the latest enterprise Java specification, while continuing to use your favorite development model. However, for advanced users, taking advantage of features which are unique to JBoss AS is what can provide a competitive edge, and in this webinar we will cover both angles. This webinar is addressing developers and architects that use Spring in their applications, both new to JBoss AS or seasoned users of a previous version of it. For new users, it will demonstrate how to run Spring applications in JBoss AS7. and for existing users it will distill the new features of JBoss AS7 from a Spring user perspective, including how Snowdrop, the JBoss extension for Spring is addressing their needs. Since staying in touch with technical advances is critical for the success of an enterprise application, a question often asked is how can Spring developers blend with CDI, the Java EE 6 native dependency injection model, to create applications which are both future-proof, but also friendly to existing code, which is another important aspect of adopting JBoss AS7 as the runtime of choice. In response to that, the webinar will cover the Spring/CDI integration which currently exists as part of the Seam project. Presenter Bio: Marius Bogoevici is a Senior Software Engineer with Red Hat, leading the JBoss AS/Spring integration efforts.

Hibernate OGM: JPA on Infinispan: when PaaS persistence meets Java EE PaaS (Platform as a Service) is all the buzz these days. But how and where do you store your data is the real challenge. In a data grid to benefit from its scalability? Via a new proprietary API? JBoss users of our enterprise middleware systems are accustomed to easy persistence via Hibernate and JPA (Java Persistence API). What if Hibernate could store your data in a grid? Hibernate Object/Grid Mapper (OGM) aims at offering a JPA front end (object manipulation and JP-QL query) to applications while storing and querying the data from a key/value grid like Infinispan. In other words, offering a familiar and well known API but benefiting from the new scalability possibilities of distributed data grids like Infinispan. That includes trying to support existing applications using JPA. In this presentation, we will see how JBoss is leveraging its existing technology to build an OGM (Object/Grid Mapper). Hibernate Core (JPA), Hibernate Search (object search engine), Teiid (query federation engine) and of course Infinispan (distributed data grid) are the foundation to this adventure. We will cover in details how the various bricks fit together, what the secret sauce is and how to use the solution in your applications."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/vimeo/26128757": {"title": ["JBoss Speed Tests: AS 7 vs. Firefox"], "type": ["video"], "tags": ["JBoss"], "date": ["2011-07-07T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": ["JBoss Application Server 7 starting at the same time as Firefox, and completing start up in time for the browser to access the server."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/vimeo/35705170": {"title": ["5 Minutes to Mobile"], "type": ["video"], "tags": [""], "date": ["2012-01-26T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": [""]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/vimeo/23280944": {"title": ["JBW - Forge New Ground in Rapid Enterprise Java Development"], "type": ["video"], "tags": ["JBoss"], "date": ["2011-05-04T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": ["Lincoln Baxter, III presents \"Forge\", a new technology-agnostic RAD framework centered around Java and Java EE applications."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/vimeo/33977278": {"title": ["Introduction to Sinatra on TorqueBox"], "type": ["video"], "tags": ["ruby"], "date": ["2011-12-20T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": ["In this short screencast, we show you how to get started quickly with the Ruby Sinatra framework on TorqueBox and make use of TorqueBox::Session::ServletStore for distributed sessions."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/vimeo/33299335": {"title": ["Installing TorqueBox 2.0"], "type": ["video"], "tags": ["ruby", "JBoss"], "date": ["2011-12-07T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": ["This 5 minute introductory video will walk you through an installation of TorqueBox 2.0 using RVM and the torquebox-server gem."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/vimeo/26278975": {"title": ["Java EE 6 with OpenShift - 1.

It lets you build scalable, microservice-based applications transparently distributed and packaged as a single jar file. This simplicity makes deploying and managing Vert.x applications on OpenShift a breeze. Upload your jar and Vert.x connects all your pods and services.

Each controller is able to expose one or more tunable or control. When mounting the cgroups filesystem, it is possible to mount the filesystem several times, with each mount point having a different set of (non-overlapping) controllers. The key idea is that this allows the administrator to construct differing group hierarchies for different sets of controllers/tunables, which offers new ways to control and manage cloud resources.

A service oriented, modular architecture will help a lot to achieve this goal. Modularity forces separation of concerns which, when combined with a service oriented architecture, enables you to replace parts of a system without breaking others. The only mature modularity approach for Java is OSGi. OSGi is a framework that enables low-level modularity and services, but it is not an application framework like Java EE, i.e. you still need APIs to create web applications, use transactions, access data sources etc. Without these APIs you will have a hard time to actually build applications. Unfortunately OSGi and Java EE did not interoperate well in the past; it was very challenging to mix both. But what if we want modularity in our architecture, but also the ease-of-use of Java EE 6? Luckily times are changing. All major application servers are getting support for deploying mixed Java EE and OSGi applications. This makes it possible to deploy OSGi bundles that contain Java EE 6 code such as EJBs, JPA and JAX-RS resources. CDI can be used to inject OSGi services and EJBs can easily be exported as OSGi services too. The next question is how to deploy this into the cloud. Just uploading a large WAR file to a server in the cloud doesn't fit modularity very well. How can you update just parts of a running application without breaking the rest of it? We will introduce Apache ACE, an Open Source Provisioning Platform to deploy OSGi bundles (containing Java EE code) and other artifacts to the cloud."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/youtube/R8Jffk5MBrc": {"title": ["JUDCon 2012 - Mobilize your application using JBoss"], "type": ["video"], "tags": ["Red Hat", "JBoss"], "date": ["2012-10-12T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": ["A JUDCon 2012 session presented by Matt Hicks.

To address this need the Interoperability group implemented key functionality which facilitated the easy exchange of data between hospital based systems and the exchange. The functionality was developed as native JBoss ESB services. Along with these services a JBoss ESB native gateway was developed to facilitate the exchange of HL7 messages between various parts of the system.

In the not too distant past, application integration was widely considered to be a post-deployment consideration. Development teams implemented business logic and packaged their application for deployment, while system integrators came in after the fact to tie applications together. With the introduction of Service Oriented Architecture, we began to see a shift where the design and implementation of a service was guided by a desire for application logic to be be used in multiple contexts and to take advantage of services offered by other applications without tightly coupling the implementations. One of the biggest challenges for developers, however, was how to realize the tangible benefits of SOA without getting swallowed by the tools and frameworks designed to get them there. This session provides an in-depth tour of how SwitchYard, the next generation Enterprise Service Bus from JBoss, gets you to SOA, easy. There's something for everyone in this talk.

Whitehurst welcomed the crowd warmly, noting that the community of contributors, users, partners, and technologists are the backbone behind Red Hat and Linux and open source success. He continued on to talk about the economy and information evolutions of today, comparing them to the revolutions in industries and ages past--agriculture, industrialization, banking. Whitehurst emphasized the transition from physical to informational assets for these institutions--and compared this to the changes in IT infrastructure and the datacenter. As our need for data storage and manipulation grows, as the tools with which to handle this data get more and more complex. Improving our technology foundations and eliminating transaction costs means we can do more, and leaves admins and developers free to innovate instead of manage. Eliminating transaction costs has also allowed for a boom in development--rapid iteration without the need for external investment (or approval). You no longer have to wait to debut the next big idea--it's as simple as logging into the cloud or offering your new app in the app store. The role that standards and standards-sharing companies will play in this new information economy is critical. Open source is now mainstream, and Red Hat--a now billion-dollar company in this space--is positioned to connect communities and drive innovation for the next generation of technology. There is no time to rest. The paradigms shift beneath our feet and we're on to the next adventure. Big data, cloud, and virtualization bring moreradical change, and the beyond-slow pace of proprietary competitors leaves Linux and open source standardization at the forefront of technology today. And Whitehurst, a self-confessed geek among other geeks at Red Hat, finds that exciting.

Standard, open operating systems like Red Hat Enterprise Linux on commodity hardware deployed as nodes create the foundation for flexible computing. Projects like Hadoop and OpenStack create technology and standards that make it possible to move workloads and consume data where and when its needed. The evolution of software-defined networking creates a common set of tools and templates that can apply to any system, whether it's in a public, private, or hybrid cloud. Open standards allow applications to be shared, and common tools, interfaces, and management mean that systems can work together. A best-of-breed toolset is available in OpenShift, the cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Red Hat that includes cutting-edge resources like MongoDB and more.

Nevertheless the biggest part of Java developers is not used yet to employ functional idioms and then they are not ready to fully leverage the new functional capabilities of Java. In particular it is still uncommon to see functions used together with data in business domain model. The purpose of this talk is not doing a comparison between object oriented and functional programming, but showing how these two styles can be combined in order to take advantage of the good parts of both. For example it's usual to pass a list of data to a function that processes them, but there are cases when you may want to create a list of functions and pass a single data through all of them. Immutable objects leads to a inherently thread-safe domain model. Functions often compose better than objects. Side-effect free code allows better reusability. This talk will demonstrate the validity of these statements with practical examples till to distil the essence of functional programming: data and behaviours are two aspects of the same thing."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/youtube/qL5BGHPXrac": {"title": ["vert.x 3 - be reactive on the JVM but not only in Java by Clement Escoffier/Paulo Lopes"], "type": ["video"], "tags": ["vert.x"], "date": ["2015-11-13T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": ["Join us in March 21-23 for Devoxx US 2017, details @ https://devoxx.us Vert.x 3 is a toolkit to create reactive applications on the Java Virtual Machine.

This session talks about the tension between architecture & design in agile projects, discussing two key elements of emergent design (utilizing the last responsible moment and harvesting idiomatic patterns) and how to de-brittlize your architecture, so that you can play nicely with others. This talk includes both proactive (test-driven development) and reactive (refactoring, metrics, visualizations, tests) approaches to discovering design, and discusses the use of custom attributes, DSLs, and other techniques for utilizing them. The goal of this talk is to provide nomenclature, strategies, and techniques for allowing design to emerge from projects as they proceed, keeping your code in sync with the problem domain."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/youtube/OJT_BZmXTdM": {"title": ["DevNation 2015 - Pulse session on all things IoT"], "type": ["video"], "tags": [""], "date": ["2015-08-14T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": [""]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/youtube/nhYR5MOe7RY": {"title": ["DevNation 2015 - Paul Bakker - Pulse Session on OSGi"], "type": ["video"], "tags": [""], "date": ["2015-08-14T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": [""]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/youtube/x4eH6EtZDUA": {"title": ["DevNation 2015 - Duncan Doyle, Tristan Tarrant - Cross-region cloud deployments with Infinispan"], "type": ["video"], "tags": [""], "date": ["2015-08-11T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": ["Infinispan is an extremely scalable, highly available, key-value datastore and data grid.

The talks cover some novel research undertaken by this summer's intern students. Transactions and NoSQL Review It is a common to forgo the use of transactions in an application due to untested performance or scalability concerns. While it is true that transactions do come at a cost, they also bring a lot of strong guarantees essential to a correctly running application. There are many differing transaction options available, each with varying costs and guarantees. Rather than dismiss transactions altogether, it would be more prudent to consider how your application would perform under a number of different transaction models and select the option that hits the right balance of performance and guarantees.  This presentation provides a useful reference for developers and architects who need the guarantees that transactions can bring, but don't know which model is right for them. In particular the presentation will: 1) Review each of the transaction options available in NoSQL today. 2) Compare ACID and Extended (relaxed ACID) transaction models and understand how these models relate to NoSQL and scalability. 3) Present performance results for a selection of transaction options under different classes of workload. Covering a single node, as well as cluster of sharded nodes. Scaling a transaction manager in the Cloud Transaction coordination systems such as Narayana rely upon storage facilities to recreate transaction state during recovery from a system crash. These logs are usually stored on RAID hard drives to maximize reliability. However, any disk I/O is relatively slow and writing the logs can become a bottleneck in high performance transaction systems. Using the fastest available disk subsystems is thus an expensive necessity for many enterprise applications. The use of a cluster of inexpensive, unreliable hardware nodes in conjunction with data replication for redundancy is an increasingly popular and cost effective architecture for many highly scalable, high reliability applications. Data grids such as Infinispan provides distributed in-memory replication of Java objects, making programming for this kind of cluster relatively simple. This presentation will cover a new transaction logging plugin for Narayana that uses a data grid to replicate the logs to main memory on other nodes in a cluster, in preference to writing them to disk. In addition, the presentation will also cover performance benchmarks and reliability trade-offs."]}, "https://developers.redhat.com/videos/youtube/RcWykg-l27k": {"title": ["Boston Java Meetup - Rapid Enterprise Development w/ EAP, JRebel, and XRebel"], "type": ["video"], "tags": ["JBoss"], "date": ["2014-08-13T00:00:00.000Z"], "description": ["Part II of the Boston Java Meetup on 12 August 2014, in which Andrew Lee Rubinger introduces the GeekSeek example application from the http://continuousdev.org book, and further inspects it with XRebel at runtime.

Abstract Docker is a tool for building portable Linux containers around an application. If you are unfamiliar with Docker, or have heard of it but never used it, then you should definitely come to this session because containers are the new virtualization. Docker is a revolution in thinking about software distribution. It makes the process of creating images with the whole application stack (OS + application server + application itself) easy and extremely fast. You can share them easily too, and images behave the same way on different machines. Differences between development and production environments are a thing of the past. But that's not everything - Docker helps you run images too by providing an easy to use interface. Sounds like magic, huh? In this session, right after introduction to Docker, Marek will dive into examples showing how you can leverage this tool to create a deployment environment for your applications. You will see how to cluster JBoss EAP and deploy an application to it. Marek will share some tips and tricks too: for example how to manage logs or customize the configuration of JBoss EAP to be able to deploy your applications.
